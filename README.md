# Real-Estate-Housing-Project
This project seeks to determine whether real estate prices are determined more by size or by location.

In this project, I work with a dataset with 21,000 properties for sale in Mexico through the real estate website Properati.com. My goal is to determine whether sale prices are influenced more by property size or location.
This project focuses on:

Organizing information using basic Python data structures.
Importing data from CSV files and cleaning it using the pandas library.
Craeting data visualizations like scatter and box plots.
Examining the relationship between two variables using correlation.
